# Trivia Game Coding Challenge

## Overview

Your challenge is to create a 10 question, true or false, trivia app in the technology you are applying to work in. **You should not just implement the most basic solution. This is a chance to show off your abilities and impress.**

**The application code will be reviewed and scored on these key areas with many subset areas for each:**

- Functionality
- Code Format
- Project Structure
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Use of industry best practices

Some specific things that we are looking for:

- Typescript if you know it
- Use of Expo for React Native projects
- Correct implementation of a state manager
- Correct implementation of a navigation solution
- Componentization
- Communication in the repo and/or code
- Best practices with API calls and data
- Separation of concerns between business and UI logic

## Goals

Implement the screens based off the wireframes and api below using **advanced techniques** and **industry best practices** for your platform. Note that the wireframes may not be complete, so use your best judgment for UI/UX implementation. **Do not use a boilerplate like React Boilerplate or Ignite for this challenge.** We want to see how you structure your project and what tooling you use from scratch. Create react app is fine to use. React Native projects should use the Expo CLI workflow: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started
